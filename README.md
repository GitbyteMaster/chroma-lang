  ## Hello!
  
</div>

If you've stumbled upon this respository, that means that you're interested in whatever this is supposed to be, want to _help_, or just want to see where this is going. All are fair approaches.

If you hadn't seen already, Chroma is an <b>experimental</b> programming language made to be incredibly flexible (or as much as possible, anyways) and to teach people like me how an actual interpreters work. Basically just a test drive that may or may not reach new heights.
```
echo "Hello World!";
```
As far as _planned_, Chroma will a basic Python-based software. I have no plans in the long run for changing any of this. With that, however, my guess is it will undergo other large changes, so you've been warned.
